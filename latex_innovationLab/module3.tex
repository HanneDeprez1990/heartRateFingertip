\begin{samenvatting}
Het meten van je hartslag met de smartphone is gebaseerd op kleurveranderingen in je vingertop, die we met de smartphone camera registreren in een video. Om goed te begrijpen hoe we die kleurveranderingen precies kunnen detecteren, is het belangrijk de basisprincipes achter digitale afbeeldingen en video te begrijpen. Daar gaan we in deze module dieper op in.
